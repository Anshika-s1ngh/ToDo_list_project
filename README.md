# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


this project is divided into two parts and will run by adding files in two different folder namely frontend and backend 
frontend folder will involve files - public , src 
backend will involve - models , Controllers , Routes ,.env and server.js file

to run the project install the necessary packages and then connect to mongodb server and then run npm run dev command in terminal
